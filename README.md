## Development Process

This app was built using SwiftUI for a responsive UI and to make the card flip animations smooth and engaging. I used `Timer` and `State` to track game progress, handle game resets, and implement the timer and score functions. The celebration screen utilizes a randomization of cat images and particle systems for the confetti effect.

## Challenges Faced

- **Animation Timing**: Ensuring smooth card flip animations with appropriate timing and transitions.
- **State Management**: Tracking the state of cards, whether flipped, matched, or face-down, was critical to avoid glitches and ensure seamless gameplay.
- **Dynamic Content**: Loading and displaying random cat images asynchronously for the celebration screen posed some challenges.
- **UI Consistency**: Maintaining a visually appealing UI across themes and devices while ensuring usability was tricky.
- **Confetti Animation**: Implementing a confetti effect for the celebration screen required using particle systems to blend seamlessly with the game.

## Key Takeaways

- Gained experience in creating dynamic and interactive UI elements with SwiftUI.
- Learned how to implement smooth animations and transitions to enhance user experience.
- Enjoyed working on visual design elements, including random image loading and confetti effects.
